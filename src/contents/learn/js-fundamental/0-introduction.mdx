JavaScript (JS) is a versatile programming language utilized for developing dynamic interactions in webpages, games, applications, and servers. It originated as part of Netscape, a web browser developed in the 1990s, and has since gained immense popularity as one of the most widely-used programming languages.

Initially, JS was created to breathe life into webpages and was limited to running within browsers. However, it has now evolved to run on any device with JavaScript engine support.

JavaScript provides a range of standard objects such as Array, Date, and Math, as well as operators, control structures, and statements. Furthermore, there are extended versions of JavaScript known as Client-side JavaScript and Server-side JavaScript.

- Client-side JavaScript empowers developers to enhance and manipulate web pages within client browsers. It facilitates interactive responses to user events, including mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.

- Server-side JavaScript enables seamless interaction with servers, databases, and file systems.

JavaScript is an interpreted language, where each line of code is interpreted and executed by an interpreter. Modern browsers leverage Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation technology to transform JavaScript into executable bytecode, optimizing its performance and efficiency.
